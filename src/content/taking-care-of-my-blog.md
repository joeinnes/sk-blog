excerpt: For about the millionth time, my interest in blogging has been renewed, and I'm planning to start blogging again.

Just read this article (below) and decided I wanted to try (again) to blog on a semi-regular basis. There will be a lot of fragments of ideas and not much fully formed.

[Take Care of Your Blog](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/take-care-of-your-blog-/)

I've been wanting to do it for a while, but I've been holding off, because I'd love to rewrite my blog into a format like [https://aegir.org/](https://aegir.org/) - I think the design there is really nice, and particularly I love the signature at the bottom of each postâ€”in fact I spent some time coming up with an animated version of my own that will play when it shows up on the screen). It's a Svelte component so when I do finally one day do my rewrite, then I'll include it, I think. For now, I'll keep it for special occasions.
