I wrote a PWA to help reduce meat consumption. It's a fairly simple app - you install it, and for every plant-based meal, you get one 'meat coin'. For every meal with meat, you use one 'meat coin'. A meal with dairy costs half a meat coin.

All data is stored locally in your browser\*. There's no log in, no cloud server, no syncing, no analytics, no nothing, just nice big buttons for you to press.

Interesting stuff I used:

- IndexedDB (super simple with [jakearchibald's key/val wrapper](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval))
- FitText.js (the [adactio](https://github.com/adactio/FitText.js) version so I don't need to use jQuery)

* this also includes the sandboxed browser PWAs run in.
