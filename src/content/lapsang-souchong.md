M﻿y order from the British Store arrived today, with, amongst other things, 3 boxes of Lapsang Souchong tea. I first came across lapsang souchong as in ingredient in a smoked duck dish a friend of mine cooked for Masterchef while I was at university, and I was fortunate enough to have been a guinea pig. S﻿he didn't win, but the dish was delicious, and I was grateful to have been allowed to help her practice.

I﻿'ve always been a bit of an oddball—an Englishman who doesn't like tea. But nothing beats a delicious cup of lapsang on a cold winter's evening. The smoky smell reminds me of wood fired heaters and bonfire night, and I love the taste of the strong black tea without milk or sweetener that makes PG Tips seems so insipid and uninspiring.

I think I first fell in love with lapsang in **Coffee In**, a trendy coffee shop in Yaroslavl, which is now long since closed, but I spent hours there, sitting with a teapot, a chess board, and friends I'm not really in touch with any more.

L﻿apsang is a bold drink, and it takes some getting used to. My wife hates it, although she's learned to tolerate the smell.

I﻿f you buy it direct from Twinings in the UK, you'll pay about 7p per teabag. Imported, I am paying 2790 HUF per pack, which works out at around 12p. But given that I can squeeze three cups out of the same teabag, it's well worth it.
