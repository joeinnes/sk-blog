M﻿y order from the British Store arrived today, with, amongst other things, 3 boxes of Lapsang Souchong tea. I first came across lapsang souchong as in ingredient in a smoked duck dish a friend of mine cooked for Masterchef while I was at university, and I was fortunate enough to have been a guinea pig.

S﻿he didn't win, but the dish was delicious, and I was grateful to have been allowed to help her practice.

The story I heard was that as traders from China passed through bandit territory on their way to England, they would stop and circle the caravan around a campfire for protection. Over time, the tea would become permeated by the wood smoke scent, and when it arrived in the UK, it would taste smoky and delicious.
