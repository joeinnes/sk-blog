I﻿f you only came here for the revelation I had the other day, it's this: use HSL.

W﻿e're so used to specifying colours as RGB values. And yes, hex codes are just another way of writing RGB (00 is 0, FF is 255, so #FF0000 is red - 255, 0, 0). 

It's hard work to keep track of what colours work well together, and most of us can't easily imagine what a colour like #D00D1E might look like instantly.

Sure, you can get there eventually if you break it down in your head: D0 is quite a lot of red, 0D is not much green at all, and 1E is a smidge of blue, so this is probably quite a bright red.

But it's INCREDIBLY easy to make good looking colour palettes with HSL. How does it work?

I﻿nstead of specifying RGB values, you pick a hue, a saturation, and a lightness (ie: an 'H', an 'S', and an 'L'). Hues are spread around a circle which mimics the old 'ROYGBIV' acronym we already know from school, running round a clock. 12 (or 0°) is red. 1 o'clock (or 30°) is orange. 2 o'clock (or 60°) is yellow. 3 o'clock (90°) is a chartreuse, 120° (or 4 o'clock) is green, 150° is an emerald green (5 o'clock), and 180° (6) is cyan. 7 is azure and 8 is ultramarine, and by 9 o'clock (or 270°) we're at violet, with magenta at 10, and a crimson colour at 11. 

T﻿his clock shows the hue wheel roughly (although the reds and yellows take up a bit more space than they should, and the greens and blues a bit less...) and starts to hint at some basic colour theory concepts—colours opposite each other on the wheel will often go together very nicely.

T﻿here are a lot of colour harmony theories out there, but one thing that is sure is that different shades of the same colour go well together.

F﻿or example, \[Traist](https://traist.co.uk)'s primary brand colour is #0C6291, which translates to 201°, 85%, 31% in HSL. Without even thinking, I know immediately that any other colour with the hue of 201 will work.
