This time next week, I'll be on the sleeper train from Budapest to Zürich. It'll be the first time I've visited my sister in nearly 10 years, and the first time I get to meet my little niece, who was born just a few weeks after my own son.

I'm incredibly excited, and I'm so happy that I'm able to take my whole family with me—my son's first travels outside Hungary, and a bit of a chance to get away from the city for me and my wife.

Can't wait!
