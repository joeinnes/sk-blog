My sister did a great job of Christmas shopping this year. I'm mostly bored of the whole giving gifts that no-one needs thing, but here are a couple that she gave that I thought were awesome.

This one isn't as socially good, but is a great idea. Often, my sister is too busy or tired to call or write a message to mum, but if she taps her lamp in Switzerland, my mum's in the UK will also light up. You can press to choose colours and the lamp slowly fades out over an hour and half.
