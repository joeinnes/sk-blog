I was reading [an article recently](https://www.1000hoursoutside.com/blog/time-with-kids-before-age-12) which I found on on HackerNews. It suggests that the adage that you only get 18 summers with your children is not true, but:

> In fact, 75% of the time we spend with our kids in our lifetime will be spent by age 12.

Unfortunately, their comments are not cited at all, and so I can't validate that figure. But it sounds probably about right, although maybe a little on the high side. We go from living with our parents to moving out—University, new homes in different cities, etc.

But it got me thinking about my own relationship with my parents.

[This article](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) does some maths on how long you might have left with your own parents. I am broadly the same age as the author, and his conclusion was that:

> It turns out that when I graduated from high school, I had already used up 93% of my in-person parent time. I’m now enjoying the last 5% of that time. We’re in the tail end.

It was a quiet reminder that these numbers are optimistic estimates that the author has two sisters, similar to me. They calculated that they probably had 15% of their time left. But the truth is that any day, that time can run out, like it did with Sandi.

I wanted to calculate if their assumptions were broadly correct and/or similar to my numbers.

Here is my working:

**1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters.** I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.

**2) Priorities matter.** Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.

**3) Quality time matters.** If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.
