From my great great grandmother, who received a telegram from the Queen on her 100th birthday, to my great grandmother, who was thrilled to win a competition to have a decoration on the Queen's Christmas tree, to my grandfather, who served in the Grenadier Guards, to my sister, who won't ever know that Charles became Kingâ€”it's surprising how much I've been impacted by the death of the figurehead of an institution I strongly disagree with.
