excerpt: A short post about where Apple goes wrong in encouraging hobbyists to build for their ecosystem. Or maybe that's what they want?

One thing I've been wanting to do for a while is to convert my app [Elpea](https://elpea.vercel.app) to allow you to use Apple Music instead of Spotify (since that's what we use at home now). It makes me sad than in order to do so, I need to have an Apple developer account, which costs 32 799 HUF/year (about 70 GBP or 80 EUR). For this single use case, I can't justify the expense.

Now there are a few other things I'd love to do with an Apple Developer accountâ€”like creating mobile apps for iPhone for example. But to do that, I'd need a better laptop (my current laptop is a Macbook Pro, but 128GB won't allow me to install XCode without basically uninstalling literally everything else).

So Elpea is languishing, my dreams of iOS apps are kept as dreams, and I'm left hoping that when the PWA improvements come on macOS, that I'll be able to use the web for whatever ideas I want to develop into reality.
