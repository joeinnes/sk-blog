I don't remember exactly when was the last date I saw my sister. I know it was about two years ago, probably 1st or 2nd of January 2019. No-one tells you that you need to remember these dates in advance.

Today has been a struggle, but it's a lot less conspicuous when the 'empty chair at the table' is just an invitee who didn't pick up on WhatsApp.
