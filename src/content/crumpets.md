Apparently, the below is Warburton's crumpet recipe... something fun for me to try out (just need to find a biscuit cutter):

### Ingredients:

_Bakes six_

- 150g plain white flour
- 200ml water
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon dried yeast

### Method:

1. Add flour, water and salt to a mixing bowl
2. Mix vigorously with a whisk until your arm aches (at least five minutes) to create your crumpet batter
3. Mix a few milliliters of water into your dried yeast
4. Add sugar, baking powder and yeast mixture to bowl and mix for another 30 seconds until you have a clear batter
5. Cover the mixing bowl and put it into a warm place for 15 minutes - top tip: make sure your mixing bowl is bigger than you need as it will expand.
6. Place a greased metal biscuit cutter into the middle of a non-stick frying pan
7. Preheat your frying pan on a hob on a medium-high setting
8. Before you start, give your batter a stir to remove any large air bubbles
9. Use a ladle to drop approximately 60g of batter into the cutter inside the pan
10. Wait for approximately four minutes - then carefully lift the ring off the crumpet
11. Remove the baked crumpet from pan - if the top looks a bit gooey, flip it over in the pan for a few seconds
12. Repeat to make the rest of the crumpets
13. Toast and enjoy with butter
