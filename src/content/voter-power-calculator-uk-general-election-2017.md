<script>
  import VoterPowerCalculator from '$lib/components/VoterPowerCalculator.svelte';
</script>

I voted for:

<VoterPowerCalculator year={2017} />

Note that votes for the speaker are excluded from calculations. If you voted for a candidate belonging to a party not on this list, then your vote was effectively worthless.
