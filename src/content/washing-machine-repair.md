It's not even your washing machine, and you spent three hours farting about with the bloody thing.

The 'easily replaceable' door seal is far from it. Cheap screws that shred with the slightest turn of the screwdriver, breeze blocks weighting the machine down, and a very tight fit around the bit that holds the drum turned your fingers into a disaster scene and your evening into a nightmare.

Don't try it again. Just call someone who knows what they're doing.

This guy makes it look easy. DON'T TRUST HIM.
