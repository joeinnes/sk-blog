Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to be submitting my application for the role of Director of Customer Support and Success, and appreciate your consideration of my C.V. and application.

I've spent the last eight years learning what it means to deliver world-class customer support from the ground up. As it stands today, I lead a team of high-performing managers who are responsible for around 220 associates working 24×7 across 10 different customers, delivering end user satisfaction levels above 91%.

I have built up teams from scratch, interviewing, hiring, and training
I started with Tata Consultancy Services 8 years ago as a Service Desk Agent, answering customer calls, chats, emails, and tickets. As an excellent communicator, I quickly became responsible for leading service review calls for the North America and Europe markets, and began wearing a number of different hats. I was entrusted with the design and implementation of quality assurance and knowledge management processes for the customer I was supporting. From there, I was promoted to Team Lead, taking ownership of performance management for a team of twenty service desk agents.

I continued to grow, moving to new relationships with new customers, solving problems and implementing best practices from across the company and my own experience to guarantee customer satisfaction—both within our clients' IT organisations, and on the ground with our clients' employees.

Over the past few years in particular, we've worked hard as a company to implement a new working model for our associates, using a combination of technical and organisational enablers to ensure that we're able to work effectively together in a geography-agnostic way. I've played a big part in this. I have successfully run remote assessment centres to identify and promote internal talent, conducted ISO 9001 compliant internal audits over video calls for the first time, and implemented new techniques for hiring external talent.

I'm looking for a role back home in the UK where I can use my skills to make a difference—where I can innovate, inspire, and excel in an organisation which is moving quickly in a growing industry.

It seems to me that we would be a great fit, and I look forward to discussing that in more detail at interview.

Yours faithfully,
