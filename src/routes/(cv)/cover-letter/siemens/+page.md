Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to be submitting my application for the role of IT Communication & Change Manager, and appreciate your consideration of my application.

I started with Tata Consultancy Services 9 years ago as a Service Desk Agent, answering customer calls, chats, emails, and tickets. As an excellent communicator, I quickly became responsible for leading service review calls for the North America and Europe markets, and began wearing a number of different hats. I was entrusted with the design and implementation of quality assurance and knowledge management processes for the customer I was supporting. From there, I was promoted to Team Lead, taking ownership of performance management for a team of twenty service desk agents.

I continued to grow, moving to new relationships with new customers, solving problems and implementing best practices from across the company and my own experience to guarantee customer satisfaction—both within our clients' IT organisations, and on the ground with our clients' employees. As it stands today, I lead a team of high-performing managers who are responsible for around 220 associates working 24×7 across 10 different customers, delivering end user satisfaction levels above 91%.

In my current role, I work closely with customer teams in developing effective OCM strategies to ensure outsourcing to TCS is a success, as well as helping project teams drive digital transformation projects by managing messaging through the Service Desk, or advising on communications strategies.

With my experiences of leading a high performing team and driving success, I'm confident that I would be a great fit for this role, and I would be happy to discuss this further at interview.

Yours faithfully,
