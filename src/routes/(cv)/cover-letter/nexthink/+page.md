Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to be submitting my application for the role of Product Manager (Employee Engagement), and appreciate your consideration of my application.

Focussing on customers' digital experience has been what I've spent the last eight years doing. I've been learning what it means to deliver world-class customer support from the ground up.

I started with Tata Consultancy Services 8 years ago as a Service Desk Agent, answering customer calls, chats, emails, and tickets. As an excellent communicator, I quickly became responsible for leading service review calls for the North America and Europe markets, and began wearing a number of different hats. I was entrusted with the design and implementation of quality assurance and knowledge management processes for the customer I was supporting. From there, I was promoted to Team Lead, taking ownership of performance management for a team of twenty service desk agents.

I continued to grow, moving to new relationships with new customers, solving problems and implementing best practices from across the company and my own experience to guarantee customer satisfaction—both within our clients' IT organisations, and on the ground with our clients' employees. As it stands today, I lead a team of high-performing managers who are responsible for around 220 associates working 24×7 across 10 different customers, delivering end user satisfaction levels above 91%.

Within TCS, I've worked an a variety of different tools for various internal stakeholders. For example, I built out a Chrome add-on, which supports our Service Desk Agents in responding more quickly to chats and emails from end user. I've built a variety of dashboards and consolidation scripts to allow project managers to get an overview of performance against SLA and KPI metrics. I've worked with HR and other support teams to develop an employee lifecycle management portal to ensure that movements within the company are tracked effectively.

I'd love to talk to you further at interview about how my experience working with IT stakeholders in customer organisations makes me an outstanding candidate for this position.

Yours faithfully,
