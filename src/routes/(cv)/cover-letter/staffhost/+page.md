Dear StaffHost Team,

I'm excited to be submitting my application for the role of ServiceNow Transformation Lead, and appreciate your consideration of my C.V. and application.

I started with Tata Consultancy Services nearly 9 years ago as a Service Desk Agent, answering customer calls, chats, emails, and tickets. As an excellent communicator, I quickly became responsible for leading service review calls for the North America and Europe markets, and began wearing a number of different hats. I was entrusted with the design and implementation of quality assurance and knowledge management processes for the customer I was supporting. From there, I was promoted to Team Lead, taking ownership of performance management for a team of twenty service desk agents.

Throughout this period, I was directly involved day-to-day in the usage of ServiceNow as part of (arguably) ServiceNow's largest user community: a Service Desk. I learned how to run complex reports across multiple tables, build dashboards to display information at a single click for various parts of customer IT organisations, and train others to do the same. I'm most proud of a Chrome extension I wrote, which used the ServiceNow API to announce customer feedback (celebrating positive survey results) to Service Desk agents in the office, which I later expanded to help provide real time announcements for agents when chats/email tickets were about to breach SLA targets.

I continued to grow, moving to new relationships with new customers, solving problems and implementing best practices from across the company and my own experience to guarantee customer satisfactionâ€”both within our clients' IT organisations, and on the ground with our clients' employees. As it stands today, I lead a team of high-performing managers who are responsible for around 220 associates across 10 different customers, delivering end user satisfaction levels above 91%.

Understanding how ServiceNow works, co-operating and collaborating with customers, and supporting their digital transformation programmes has been a core part of my role for several years now, and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss how I could be the right fit for this role in more detail at interview.

Yours faithfully,
